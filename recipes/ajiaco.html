        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Ajiaco
            is a traditional Colombian soup from the mountains
            around Bogota. It's a hearty, thick soup defined by 
            potatoes that break down during the boiling process 
            and the dried guascas that give it a unique flavor. 
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bone-in Chicken Breast(May replace with 
                boneless chicken breast and bone-in 
                chicken thigh)</li>
            <li>Papas Criollas</li>
            <li>Russet Potatoes</li>
            <li>Red Potatoes</li>
            <li>Corn on the Cob</li>
            <li>Yellow Onions</li>
            <li>Green Onions</li>
            <li>Bay Leaves</li>
            <li>Cilantro</li>
            <li>Dried Guascas</li>
            <li>Green Onions</li>
            <li>Table Cream</li>
            <li>Capers</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Sazon Todo</li>
            <li>Chicken Bouillion</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>Onion Powder</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinade the chicken overnight with a good amount of salt,
                pepper, the garlic and onion powders, the 
                sazon todo, and soy sauce. I like to add culantro, annato, and 
                smoked paprika to this marinade also, but it's 
                optional. 
            </li>
            <li>Sear the chicken under medium to high
                heat in the pot you're going to use for the soup.
                This'll release fat and marrow from the bone and
                just make the chicken taste better. The chicken 
                doesn't have to be cooked through at this stage;
                we're just searing for flavor now.When The skin is 
                starting to look good, add the chopped onions so 
                they can cook in the chicken fat until they smell
                good and start to look broken down.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill the pot around 3/4 of the way with water and add 
                the bay leaves, potatoes, and guascas at this point.
                Bring to a boil under high heat, and then leave at a 
                simmer until the chicken is cooked through. Take the 
                chicken out when it's cooked to let cool while the potatoes
                keep cooking and eventually breaking down.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the chicken is cool enough to handle, tear it with
                either your fingers or a fork. When the soup is in a state
                where it's decently thickened but there are still some 
                large potato chunks in there add the ears of corn. Season
                the soup to taste with the spices mentioned earlier and 
                the chicken bouillion.

            </li>
            <li>
                Add shredded chicken and cilantro to individual bowls 
                and serve. May also add table cream to each individual
                bowl to taste.
            </li>
        </ol>
